    <p>
    I just need someone in my life to give it structure<br>
    To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her<br>
    You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers<br>
    You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder<br>
    Giving me love when you are down and need another<br>
    I've gotta get away and let you go, I've gotta get over<p></p>
    But I love you so<br>
    I love you so<br>
    I love you so<br>
    I love you so<p></p>
    I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind<br>
    This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind<br>
    I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul<br>
    Cause you were cool and I'm a fool<br>
    So please let me go<p></p>
    But I love you so (please let me go)<br>
    I love you so (please let me go)<br>
    I love you so (please let me go)<br>
    I love you so
